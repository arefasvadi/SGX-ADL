* add error and line number for abort messages for debugging!
* build model-weight class
* encrypt network config file and send it
* build data class
* follow train-cifar code
** configuration and weight file is loaded through load_network  
** training is done through train_network_sgd 
** handle random batch
* follow predict-cifar code
** network_predict
** network_predict_data
* variables
** net->subdivisions 
** net->batch
** net->seen
* functions
** get_random_batch
** get_next_batch
* fix load net config part 
** function basecfg not needed!
** load_network accepts config file and weight file 
*** parse_network_cfg
**** read_cfg
***** reads a file!
***** this function must be overriden 
***** look into fgetl function 
**** modify error function 
**** make_network 
**** parse_net_options 
***** must be overriden!
**** fprintf on stderr
**** get_network_output_layer is fine 
**** check all these parse_sth 
*** load_weights
**** fprintf, fflush
**** file_error, fopen 
**** fread override
**** all these load_*_weights use file api of libc 
**** also save_*_weights do the same! 
*** clear then net->seen = 0
** should I change learning rate with respect to available threads! since there is no gpu inside SGX? 
** imgs var goes into args of type load_args
** dataconfig file is fed into read_data_cfg function 
** load_thread and load_data functions 
** load_image_color check if it is used  
** call to train_network functionality 
** call to save_weights and its overrides 
** load_weights for predictions 
* use template variables for DNNConfig Class
* try giving options manually in code! 
* check all TODOS
* darknet header API 
* Make trainer a singleton class
** removing pthread related stuff!
*** load_data  
*** load_data_in_thread
** removing file related functions
*** fgetl
** removing clock related functions 
*** sec function 
* bad design for cache -- make static variables part of object and implement referenced singletion instead
* first test blocking on simple test withoout encryption
* make sure encryption/cmacs are implemented
* better logging mechanisms
* Meging with master
** Remove cost from last year!
** art.c
*** cVCapture is changed to open_video_stream
** cifar.c
*** save_image_options changed to save_image_png or sth else
** coco.c
*** showimage changed
** other example files too: regressor.c, segmenter, super, yolo
** darknet.h
*** change line of sec num, gpu index
*** selu added activations
*** Put all blocking code at the bottom
*** then put everything as it should go and wrap it around ifdef use_sgx
** softmax layer
** parser.cpp
*** softmax no loss
*** network config iseg and numload
*** load conv weights and similar
*** option_list
